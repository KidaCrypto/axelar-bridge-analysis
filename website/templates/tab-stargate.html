    Stargate is a DeFi Bridge developed by LayerZero that allows users to bridge tokens across the chains. Launched in March 2022, it has since bridged over <strong>$5.55B</strong> worth of tokens to their destination chains, and in recent months, slowly gaining more momentum in daily bridging volume.
</p>
<p>
    This bridge mainly supports tokens such as USDC, USDT, and BUSD, besides its own governance token, STG. The bridge utilizes liquidity pools on both source and destination chains to facilitate the bridging process. For example, if a user wants to bridge USDC from the Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum, the user first sends USDC to the S*USDC pool in Ethereum, and after a while the S*USDC pool in Arbitrum sends the USDC to the user from its liquidity pool. A small fee is paid in the form of the source chain's native gas token (in this case ETH) as bridging fee, thus the user gets more or less the same amount of USDC they've sent in the source chain. Bridging the STG token is a much simpler process, where the contracts mints and burns tokens from the source and destination chains respectively.
</p>
<h3 class="mt-5">Volume</h3>
<p>
    Stargate didn't exactly have an explosive start, in fact, it was quite mediocre with less $5M in volume on most days while having $10M-$40M volume spikes on a good day. On the other hand, bigger bridges like Multichain were having that kind of volume on the Ethereum mainnet alone.
</p>
<p>
    However, an uptrend began to form around 10 to 24 March 2023, where the bridging volume and the number of users began achieving new highs. The median amount in USD in April 2023 went about <strong>4x</strong> as high as its previous month while the number of daily users skyrocketed from 3357 to more than 60k from March to April 2023, which is a <strong>19x increase</strong> in user count!
</p>
<h3 class="mt-5">Liquidity</h3>
<p>
    On the liquidity side of things, deposits started gaining traction around November 2022, with a significant increase in March 2023. However, despite the massive increase in the number of deposit transactions, this did not bring about an increase in the net amount USD deposited. This can only mean one thing, <strong>depositors are depositing small amounts of money</strong> into the pools.
</p>
<h3 class="mt-5">Bridger Trading Activities</h3>
<p>
    Hypothetically, an increase in bridging activity tends to have increased DeFi activity by the bridgers. In DeFi, swaps in DEXs are one of the main indicator of a user's DeFi activity. Hence, in Stargate's case where bridging is booming, we should expect to see an increase in swapping activity too. However, this was not the case. The amount of swaps done by the bridgers had not gone up, rather, the <strong>swapping activity maintained at values before the boom</strong> in bridgers. 
</p>
<h3 class="mt-5">Partners</h3>
<p>
    In DeFi, partnering up with multiple other DeFi protocols to boost your own protocol's usage is a sound strategy, in Stargate's case, they partnered up with the likes of SushiSwap, Woo Finance, and Rubic to help these protocols go cross-chain and exposes their users to the wider ecosystem. Initially, it was thought that these partnerships ramped up Stargate's activities. Thus, an investigation into the bridge initiator (smart contracts that the user initially interacts with in the same transaction) was carried out.
</p>
<p>
    The results of this investigation show that the partnerships did increase the usage of Stargate in the bridging scene, however, the users gained from the partnerships are much lower than the expected amount. SushiSwap's integration of Stargate went as far back as July 2022, since then, its contribution is less than 2% of Stargate's total user count on average. Woo Finance's partnership in March had a greater effect, where it contributes around 10% of the user count. Rubic performed worse than SushiSwap. All in all, <strong>partnerships, while useful, did not bring about its recent success</strong>.
</p>
<h3 class="mt-5">Bridger Boom Periods</h3>
<p>
    The first bridger boom was on 21 September 2022. On that day, Stargate launched a Galxe Quest which was hosted on <a href="https://app.optimism.io/quests/stargate-bridge-optimism" target="_blank">Optimism's own domain</a>. Besides that, Optimism also <a href="https://twitter.com/optimismFND/status/1572284493318488070" target="_blank">tweeted</a> about the campaign on its official twitter account which has over 485k followers. The reward was a cross-chain NFT that can be traded on Opensea. The campaign ran for a week and although it did caused a rather steep decline on the day it ended (3 October), the marketing was a success. The following weeks saw a substantial increase in users and bridging volume when compared to the activity before the campaign.
</p>
<p>
    As time goes on, Stargate's popularity started to die down. Although more and more projects started integrating Stargate into their protocol, the user count and volume came and went. As future seems bleak once again, something happened. Around the mid of March 2023, Stargate gone through another burst in user count and transaction volume, and this time, the effects are much greater than their previous campaign.
</p>
<p>
    So what happened? <strong>Arbitrum's $ARB token airdrop happened</strong>. What does this has to do with Stargate, you might ask. As it is, Arbitrum's airdrop was a significant one, where at the minimum, users were airdropped 625 $ARB, worth around $1k at the time of writing. Those who were active on Arbitrum were airdropped a max of around 10,250 $ARB. A few lucky ones were able to sell $ARB for more than $5 a piece, bringing the total value of airdrop to be at least $3k for those people. 
</p>
<p>
    As it goes, high value airdrops always bring about speculation. Thus, people were talking about which chains and protocols that should be used to increase the chance of getting an airdrop in the future. Remember that Stargate is developed by LayerZero? Well, you guessed it, LayerZero was among those protocols. The entire Crypto Twitter was talking about how to maximize airdrop farming, and one of them was to use LayerZero's protocols, which in turn, means that Stargate is getting all the attention.
</p>
<p>
    Proof:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://twitter.com/Abrahamchase09/status/1637351342149627905" target="_blank">Twitter Airdrop Thread 1</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://twitter.com/ETH_Daily/status/1652713430678216704" target="_blank">Twitter Airdrop Thread 2</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://twitter.com/mztacat/status/1654467333962727428" target="_blank">Twitter Airdrop Thread 3</a></li>
        <li>And many more.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Other proofs of airdrop hunting activity driving up Stargate's usage are the fact that despite higher bridging volume, there are little to no significant increase in deposits into the protocol, there are no increase in DeFi activity by the bridgers, and that bridging volume's increment is a lot lower than the user count's increment. These are common strategies used by airdrop hunters to maximize their airdrop allocations, where they can spend the minimum amount of capital to get mulitple airdrops on multiple addresses. Since they are aiming for the minimum airdrop allocation per address, there is no need to deploy large capitals for the addresses.
</p>
<p>
    And the rest is history, Stargate's popularity is growing day by day as of writing, where bridging volume and user count consistently hit monthly highs. Whether or not this airdrop hunting activity is healthy, only time will tell. In any case, publicity is publicity, there is no downside of getting more exposure, in addition to the fact that all these attention came about without costing a single cent.
</p>
<p>
    In conclusion, Stargate's only attempt at getting exposure was through a <strong>Galxe Campaign hosted by Optimism</strong>, while the second burst of activity was caused by <strong>Airdrop Hunters</strong> driven based on wild speculations on Twitter.

<h3 class="mt-5">Bridger Stats</h3>
<p>
    Who are the bridgers? What do they like? Where are they bridging from? Let's find out!
</p>
<p>
    Firstly, the richer bridgers live in the Ethereum mainnet, where they tend to bridge a much larger sum of money per transaction than their peers on the other chains. This comes not as a surprise as Ethereum users have to bear the burden of higher gas fees, such that bridging a small amount of money makes no sense as the transaction fee will most likely be higher than the amount bridged.
</p>
<p>
    Secondly, among the tokens bridged, USDC and USDT are the bridgers' favorite tokens, by far! This, once again, is no surprise. Stablecoins are widely accepted in most chains whereas non-stables are harder to liquidate in other chains. Besides being harder, there tends to be higher slippage when swapping in another chain since there will be less liquidity. Thus, the only way to ensure that the value bridged remain the same is by bridging a stablecoin, where USDC and USDT reigns supreme. 
</p>
<p>
    Thirdly, Stargate bridgers mostly prefers Arbitrum, Avalanche, and BSC as their L2 solution. Although Polygon and Optimism are less preferred, their overall standing isn't too far behind either. This indicates that the bridgers are truly experiencing the multichain experience.
</p>
<p>
    Fourthly, the richer Stargate patrons tend to be more active. <strong>With far higher stats in median days active, median transaction count, and total amount bridged, this group of users is the heart and soul of the protocol</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Last but not least, Stargate bridgers tend to swap more using Curve. Since the bridgers mostly use stablecoins and that Curve has the largest stablecoin pool, this result is only natural.
</p>
